Our paper [On the Duality Between Retinex and Image Dehazing]({{ site.url }}/publication/2018-04-11-galdran_duality_2018) has been accepted to [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/), to be held next June in Salt Lake City. The camera ready version of the paper is now available on arxiv through [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02754).

In this work, we prove that image enhancement algorithms based on the retinex color vision model and dehazing algorithms based on Kochsmieder's model are related at a fundamental, modelling level. Extensive experiments show how we can obtain state of the art image dehazing results using retinex implementations over images with inverted intensities, and inverting back the result.
