Our paper ["Self-Supervised Blur Detection from Synthetically Blurred Scenes"]({{ site.url }}/publication/2019-08-25-alvarez-gila_self-supervised_2019) just got accepted for publication at the [_Image and Vision Computing_ journal](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/image-and-vision-computing) (Q1).

The paper, shared work between Tecnalia and the Computer Vision Center/Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, makes use of synthetic blurring to show how we can use self-supervised and weakly supervised learning techniques to train a Convolutional Neural Net on the task of segmenting the defocus or motion-blurred areas of an image without having access to images annotated under real blur.
