The slides of our presentation at the _Physics-Based vision meets Deep Learning_ (PBDL) workshop at ICCV 2017, corresponding to our paper _Adversarial Networks for Spatial Context-Aware Spectral Image Reconstruction from RGB_, are now avaiable [here]({{ site.url }}/publication/2017-10-10-alvarez-gila_adversarial_2017).

In addition, we also provide the [ICVL dataset](http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/hyperspectral/) train-test splits used during the experimental evaluation.
We have updated the arxiv version of the paper, which now shows this information in the supplementary material section, and updated the quantitative results in Table 1 for other's methods.
