I will be giving an introductory talk to deep learning next Thursday, June 1st 2017, as part of the [workshop on deep learning](http://www.tecnalia.com/en/industry-and-transport/events/deep-learning-workshop-a-technological-revolution-of-100000-million.htm) that we are organizing at tecnalia.

During the workshop, we will be showing some success stories for different applications where deep learning techniques helped improve the performance, or even enabled features that were not possible before.
