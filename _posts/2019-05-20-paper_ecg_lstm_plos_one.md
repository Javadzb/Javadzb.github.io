Our paper ["Mixed Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory Network for the Detection of Lethal Ventricular Arrhythmia"]({{ site.url }}/publication/2019-05-20-picon_mixed_2019a) was just published on [_PLOS ONE_](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216756).

This is shared work between Tecnalia's Computer Vision Group and the [Research group on Bioengineering and Resuscitation (Biores)](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/biores/home) from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). The paper shows how, by applying a neural network comrising convolutional and LSTM modules, we can successfully detect lethal ventricular arrhythmia on Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients.
