Description
-----------

The attached files contain the file identifiers that define the ICVL dataset [1] train-test partitions used in the experimental section of our paper [2].


Content
-------

* train0.csv: training set images of fold 0.
* test0.csv: testing set images of fold 0.
* train1.csv:  training set images of fold 1. 
* test1.csv: testing set images of fold 1.

Note that, since we perform a 2-fold cross validation, train0.csv == test1.csv, and train1.csv == test0.csv
