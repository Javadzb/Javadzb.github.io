This is Aitor Alvarez-Gila's personal webpage.

My main research interests are deep learning and other machine learning models for image understanding, color and spectral imaging.

I am a senior researcher at Tecnalia's Computer Vision Group (2010-), where I have made stuff that work on these and other topics (3D reconstruction, image enhancement for adverse weather, radiometry, etc.) for biomedical, steelmaking, agro and packaging industries, among others.

Since 2016, I am also a PhD candidate in deep learning at [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/)-[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](http://www.uab.cat/)'s [LAMP (Learning And Machine Perception)](http://www.cvc.uab.es/LAMP/) team 
 
Prior to that, I completed the Erasmus Mundus Master CIMET (Color in Informatics and Media Technology)in machine vision and colour science and made research stays in the Universities of Granada, Saint-Etienne, Gjøvik and Amsterdam from 2008 until 2010.

In past lifes, I've also been a consultant in a dark suit working for multinational financial companies and public administration.

I even have a darker past life doing research on network security at the University of the Basque Country, where I first graduated as 
Telecommunications Engineer (2005).
