This is Aitor Alvarez-Gila's personal webpage.

My main research interests are deep learning and other machine learning and computer vision models for image understanding, color and spectral imaging.

I am a senior researcher at [Tecnalia's Computer Vision Group](http://www.computervisionbytecnalia.com/en/) where I have been making stuff that work on these and other topics (3D reconstruction, image enhancement for adverse weather, radiometry, etc.) since 2010 for biomedical, steelmaking, agro and packaging industries, among others.

Since 2016, I am also a PhD candidate in deep learning at [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/)'s [LAMP (Learning And Machine Perception)](http://www.cvc.uab.es/LAMP/) team, in Barcelona. 
 
Prior to that, I completed the [Erasmus Mundus CIMET Master (Color in Informatics and Media Technology)](https://master-colorscience.eu/programme/cimet-master-degree/) in color science and computer vision and made research stays in the Universities of Granada (ES), Saint-Etienne (FR), Gj√∏vik (NO) and Amsterdam (NL) from 2008 until 2010.

In past lives, I've also been a consultant in a dark suit working for multinational financial companies and public administration.

I even have a darker past life doing research on network security at the University of the Basque Country, where I first graduated as 
Telecommunications Engineer (2005).
