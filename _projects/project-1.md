Develope cutting edge deep learning methods for identefying the complex objects in the waste stream. We proposed solutions to a diverse range of vision tasks including instance segmentation, object detection and domain adaptation are proposed. The highly accurate and low latency methods incorporating artificial intelligence in the recycling industry are now deployed in many United States and Europe facilities.
